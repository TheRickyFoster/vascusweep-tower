# 🌪️ VascuSweep Tower 🌲  
**Autonomous Acoustic Dispersal System for Wildfire Prevention & Ecosystem Resilience**

---

## 🧭 Overview

**VascuSweep Tower** is an advanced **bio-acoustic dispersal and detection platform** engineered to mitigate wildfires, detect high-risk zones, and deliver regenerative spore payloads with precision and autonomy.

It forms a core component of the **Symbiote Ecosystem Defense Grid**, integrating seamlessly with systems like [SymFungi Shield](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/symfungi-shield) for mycelial regrowth and [EdenCore](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/edencore) for planetary restoration.

## 🌐 Mission Purpose

> 🔥 Stop fires before they spread.  
> 🛠️ Deploy acoustic-triggered payloads.  
> 🌱 Regrow what was lost.  
> 💡 Use intelligence over intensity.  

VascuSweep Tower represents a future where defense and healing go hand-in-hand — blending physics, AI, environmental science, and decentralized action.
